## Introduction  

tidyRSS is a package for extracting data from [RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). It has one function, `tidyfeed()`, which takes one argument, the url of the feed. Included in the package is a simple dataset, a list of feed urls, which you can use to experiment with (they were taken from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataWookie/feedeR/master/tests/testthat/test-feeds.txt) and then put into a data frame with `strsplit()`). This vignette is designed to give you an idea of what tidyrss can be used for.  

## Installation

At the moment, the package is only available from GitHub and is being submitted to CRAN. It can be installed using the devtools package.

```{r, eval = F}

devtools::install_github("https://github.com/RobertMyles/tidyrss")

```

## Usage 

As tidyRSS is based on the idea of tidy data, it forms part of the [tidyverse](), which means that it plays nice with any tidy-style package. Visualizations, summaries, further manipulation is all easy thanks to this underlying common structure.
