# v2.0.0

This version is a rewrite of the package, removing the functionality of parsing feeds into tibbles with geographic simple features columns into a sister package. I've adopted a more stringent testing strategy along with much more streamlined code.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
